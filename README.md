Polymer Starter Kit (required)

Download the polymer starter kit (https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit)
 
Then can you then please add a login page to the starter kit (replace one of the current views or add your own) with a form that contains
An ‘email’ box which takes a valid email
A ‘password’ box which takes a valid password (over 8 characters)
A ‘confirm password’ box which is valid if the same as the password box
And a submit button that only allows a submit to occur if the email, password and confirm password boxes are valid
P.S. https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/iron-form and https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-input may be very useful here.

(Optional) Write tests for the above Polymer code using web component tester (https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
